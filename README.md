This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving strict equality (===) and the difference between null and undefined. The 'bug.js' file showcases code that fails to correctly handle undefined values when expecting null, while 'bugSolution.js' provides a corrected version.  This is a subtle error that can easily be missed and can lead to unexpected application behavior.
